#summary The authentication process

= Services Authentication =

During the course of using the last.fm webservices (the namespace Lastfm.Services), you're going to be needing an API account "Key" and "Secret" values. You can obtain those from [http://www.last.fm/api/account there].

In order to perform _write_ operations to a last.fm user profile, you're going to need this user's permission at the end of which you'll receive a "Session Key" value that you're going to use as well.

The lifetime of a _session key_ is infinite, unless the user provokes your rights to access his profile. You should store it somewhere for later use.

== User authentication example (in C#) ==

{{{
using System;
using Lastfm.Services;

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	// Do not use those values, replace with your own.
	string API_KEY = "b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026";
	string API_SECRET = "361505f8eeaf61426ef95a4317482251";
			
	Authenticator auth = Authenticator.Create(APIKey, Secret);
	Console.WriteLine("Please open the following line in your browser and complete the authentication process, then press Enter...");
	Console.WriteLine(auth.GetAuthenticationURL());
	Console.ReadLine();
	
	string SessionKey = auth.GetSessionKey();
	Console.WriteLine("Authentication successfull. Thank you.");
}
}}}
